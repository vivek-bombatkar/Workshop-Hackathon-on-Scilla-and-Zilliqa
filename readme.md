# Zilliqa Blockchain Workshop & Hackathon for Developers, King's College London
This repositry is my collection of notes and realted documents for the workshop and hackathon by Zilliqa.  

### Zilliqa - the scalable and secure blockchain platform for hosting decentralized applications.  
### SCILLA  - Safe-By-Design intermediate-level smart contract language being developed for Zilliqa.

- Zilliqa capable of processing thousands of transactions per second with ***sharding*** built into it.

    - sharding is a mandatory approach for scalability of blockchains which want to be more than just settlement layers.  
    - is a mechanism that allows the Zilliqa network to be divided into smaller groups of nodes each referred to as a shard. 
    - Simply put, imagine a network of 1,000 nodes, then, one may divide the network into 10 shards each composed of 100 nodes.  

- Zilliqa has the potential to match throughput benchmarks set by traditional payment methods (such as VISA and MasterCard). More importantly, Zilliqaâ€™s transaction throughput increases (roughly) linearly with its network size.  

- High throughput- you can focus on developing your ideas without worrying about network congestion, high transaction fees or security which are the key issues with legacy blockchain platforms.

- The approach that Zilliqa has chosen with sharding is that every single node will have a copy of the current state (the bank balances in our example) but then the transactions history will be split in pieces so that not everyone will have to have a full copy of it.

(* HelloWorld contract *)

contract HelloWorld

field welcome_msg : String = ""

transition setHello (msg : String)
  is_owner = builtin eq owner _sender;
  match is_owner with
  | False =>
    msg = {_tag : "Main"; _recipient : _sender; _amount : Uint128 0; code : not_owner_code};
    msgs = one_msg msg;
    send msgs
  | True =>
    welcome_msg := msg;
    msg = {_tag : "Main"; _recipient : _sender; _amount : Uint128 0; code : set_hello_code};
    msgs = one_msg msg;
    send msgs
  end
end


transition getHello ()
    r <- welcome_msg;
    e = { _eventname : "SedingHello"; caller : _sender; msg : r };
    event e
end

```

- Message vs Event
| Message | Event | 
| -- | -- | 
| internal between nodes | to the external world | 
|  |  ```    r <- welcome_msg;
    e = { _eventname : "SedingHello"; caller : _sender; msg : r };
    event e ``` |
