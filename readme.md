# Zilliqa Blockchain Workshop & Hackathon for Developers, King's College London
This repositry is my collection of notes and realted documents for the workshop and hackathon by Zilliqa.  

- 
- Zilliqa - the scalable and secure blockchain platform for hosting decentralized applications.  
- SCILLA  - Safe-By-Design intermediate-level smart contract language being developed for Zilliqa.  

> [ide for Zilliqa smart contracts ](https://ide.zilliqa.com/)  

-  Zilliqa capable of processing thousands of transactions per second with ***sharding*** built into it.   
- Sharding 

- Zilliqa has the potential to match throughput benchmarks set by traditional payment methods (such as VISA and MasterCard). More importantly, Zilliqaâ€™s transaction throughput increases (roughly) linearly with its network size.  

- High throughput- you can focus on developing your ideas without worrying about network congestion, high transaction fees or security which are the key issues with legacy blockchain platforms.
